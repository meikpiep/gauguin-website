This is an Android app, based on:

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* classical XML views
* [Google Material](https://m3.material.io/) UI (via [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android))

* [Roborazzi](https://github.com/takahirom/roborazzi) screenshot tests (not automated via build yet)

## Naming

What's with the name? Why 'Gauguin'?

I was searching for a good color palette to use. And I stumbled over [Color Lisa](https://colorlisa.com/), a beautiful website showing color palettes of a list of famous painters. I tried many of the 
colors playing with the colors, primary by ceating themes via the [Material Theme Builder website](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/).

That's the point in time where the app (being an unnamed fork of HoloKenMod), got in touch with Paul Gauguin, his painting [The Siesta](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436449). Since then, the Gauguin theme is heavily based on the colors from this painting.

Later in time, I had to choose a name for the app, to get it deployed via [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.piepmeyer.gauguin/) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.piepmeyer.gauguin). I searched for a creative, unique, intuitive app name, but I did not manage to find a single name matching with these criteria.

I played with 'Gauguin', but I rejected it multiple times, as the name is neither unique nor implies anything about an app, a game, a KenKen game or anything. As I did not find the bright shining, one-and-only, best app name, I simply chose 'Gauguin'. The colors and the theme were there, so let it title 'Gauguin'.

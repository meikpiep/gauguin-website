You solve a grid by putting a value for each cell. Each grid has **exactly one solution**.

Here are the rules:

- Each value has to be put into each column exactly once. 
- Each value has to be put into each row exactly once.
- Each cage has to satisfy its result by applying the given operation.

## Examples

- A cage with 3 cells in a row and **6+** may have 1, 2, 3 in its cells, in any order:
  - 1, 2, 3 
  - 1, 3, 2
  - 2, 1, 3
  - 2, 3, 1
  - 3, 1, 2
  - 3, 2, 1
- A cage with 2 cells and **6*** may have two values whose product is 6:
  - 1, 6
  - 2, 3
  - 3, 2
  - 6, 1
- A cage with 2 cells and **6รท** may have:
  - 1, 6
  - 6, 1
  This means: The order of the values is not relevant.
- A cage with 2 cells and **1-** may have any two values whose difference is 1:
  - 1, 2
  - 2, 1
  - 2, 3
  - 3, 1
  - 3, 5
  - ...

This cage types **รท** and **-** always come with exactly 2 cells as these operations is defined 
for two operants only.
